# Dongle-Smartcontract

Your Onchain App Store

## Overview

Dongle is a decentralized marketplace on Stellar where developers can register their dApps and users can discover, review, and verify them. It works like an app store, but fully on-chain to ensure transparency and community trust.

The smart contracts handle:

Project Registry: Developers list their dApps with metadata such as name, description, and category.

Reviews & Ratings: Users leave star ratings (1–5) and optional comments, with averages calculated on-chain.

Verification System: Project owners request verification by submitting evidence and paying a fee in Stellar assets (e.g., XLM or USDC). Admins decide on verification status. 

Fee Handling: Verification fees are automatically transferred to an admin/treasury address.

## Purpose

Dongle brings discoverability and trust to the Stellar ecosystem, enabling users to find reliable dApps and developers to showcase their projects in a transparent, decentralized way.
