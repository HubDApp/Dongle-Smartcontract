# Dongle-Smartcontract

## Overview

**Dongle** is an open-source smart contract built on the **Stellar network**.
The contract is designed to support a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer, enabling structured registration and management of application metadata on-chain.

Dongle aims to serve as a foundational protocol that frontend applications and indexers can build on to surface, organize, and interact with Stellar-based projects in a transparent and verifiable way.

This repository focuses **only on the smart contract logic**. Frontend interfaces and off-chain indexing are handled separately.

## Quick Start

The smart contract is located in the `dongle-smartcontract/` directory. For comprehensive documentation, usage examples, and API reference, please see the [dongle-smartcontract README](dongle-smartcontract/README.md).

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.74.0+
- Soroban CLI
- wasm32-unknown-unknown target

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli --features opt
```

### Build

```bash
cd dongle-smartcontract
make build
# or
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Optimize WASM

After building, run the optimization step before deploying to reduce on-chain storage costs
and improve execution performance.

```bash
# Build first
cargo build -p dongle-contract --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Optimize (requires stellar-cli installed with wasm-opt support)
bash scripts/optimize_wasm.sh
# or with explicit paths:
bash scripts/optimize_wasm.sh \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dongle_contract.wasm \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dongle_contract.optimized.wasm
```

Install the Stellar CLI with optimization support:

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

**When to use the optimized artifact:**

- **Testnet / Mainnet deployments** — always use `dongle_contract.optimized.wasm`.
  It is smaller (lower fees) and faster to execute.
- **Local development** — the unoptimized `dongle_contract.wasm` is fine; it
  builds faster and includes debug symbols.
- **CI** — the `optimize` job in CI builds and uploads the optimized artifact
  as `dongle_contract_optimized` so every merged commit has a verified,
  deployment-ready WASM.

The unoptimized file is safe to use for local invocations and snapshot tests.
Always deploy the `.optimized.wasm` in production environments.

### Test

```bash
cd dongle-smartcontract
make test
# or
cargo test
```

Run a specific test:

```bash
cargo test test_register_project_success
```

Run tests with output:

```bash
make test-verbose
# or
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Deploy and Invoke via Scripts

Convenient deployment and invocation scripts are available under the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Configure deployment variables (or define in a .env file)
export DEPLOYER_IDENTITY=alice

# Deploy to Testnet (saves Contract ID to .contract_id)
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh

# Initialize contract with default admin
./scripts/initialize.sh

# Invoke common contract methods (e.g. register a project)
./scripts/invoke.sh register <owner_address> "My Project" "my-project" "Description" "DeFi"
```

For a comprehensive guide on configuration and scripts, refer to the [dongle-smartcontract README](dongle-smartcontract/README.md).

## Problem Statement

Discoverability and trust remain challenges in decentralized ecosystems. Many projects rely on off-chain listings, centralized platforms, or unverifiable data sources.

Dongle addresses this by:

- Providing an on-chain source of truth for project registration
- Enabling transparent project metadata storage
- Allowing permissionless access to registered project data
- Supporting open-source collaboration and extension

## Scope of This Contract

The Dongle smart contract is responsible for:

- Registering projects on-chain
- Storing essential metadata (name, description, links, owner)
- Allowing controlled updates by project owners
- Exposing read methods for frontend and indexers
- Ensuring basic validation and access control
- Managing project reviews and ratings
- Handling project verification and renewal
- Supporting project linking and collections
- Providing admin tools for moderation

## High-Level Architecture

- **Blockchain:** Stellar
- **Smart Contract Framework:** Soroban
- **Language:** Rust
- **Storage:** Soroban persistent storage
- **Access Control:** Address-based ownership

### Key Error Types

The contract uses error codes for different failure scenarios. See [Common Error Types](./CONTRACT_INTERFACE.md#common-error-types) for complete error documentation.

### Authorization Model

- **Permissionless**: Project registration, reviews, project queries
- **Owner-only**: Project updates, ownership transfers, dependency management
- **Admin-only**: Verification approval, collection management, moderation actions, configuration
- **None**: All read-only operations are permissionless

### Best Practices for Integration

1. **Always handle Result types** – Functions may fail; check error codes
2. **Verify ownership** – For sensitive operations, confirm caller authorization
3. **Use pagination** – Large queries should use start/limit parameters
4. **Check project status** – Archived projects behave differently
5. **Monitor verification status** – Use verification checks before trust decisions
6. **Manage TTLs** – Keep important data alive with TTL extension calls
